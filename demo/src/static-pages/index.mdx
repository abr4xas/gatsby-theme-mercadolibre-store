## Setup your Store

### Import data
Open `gatsby-config.js` and add your MercadoLibre info.

```javascript
options: {
  mercadoLibre: {
    siteID: "yoursiteid",
    user: "youruser",
  }
}
```
<a href="https://github.com/florantara/gatsby-source-mercadolibre/#readme" target="_blank">Read more ></a>

### Paths and Pagination
You can customize the slug for the products listing and the detail page paths.

The default pagination format is a "load more" button, but you can setup "paginated" pagination.

```javascript
options: {
  productDetail: {
    slug: "producto",
  },
  productsListing: {
    slug: "productos",
    enablePagination: true, // defaults to false
    productsListingPerPage: 3
  },
}
```

### Title and Logo
Use the `siteMetadata` for the `title`. We'll use this for SEO, and if there isn't a logo image.


```javascript
siteMetadata: {
  title: "Plants Store",
}
```

To import a logo, configure:

```javascript
options: {
  site: {
    logoURL:
      "https://placeholder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/placeholder.com-logo3.jpg",
    }
  }
}
```

## Theming
Most components come with a [Theme UI variant](https://theme-ui.com/guides/variants) setup you can use to style them, or you can style any component that the [Theme Spec](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec) provides.

#### Override the settings

Create the file `settings/theme.js` in the site's `src` folder and add the following:

```javascript
import { theme as baseTheme } from "gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/src/settings/theme"

export const theme = {
  ...baseTheme,
  // Your overrides here
}

```

## Site settings
We provide a set of settings for hiding/showing things, like the price on the products and the category, and also other site-wide configurations.   

Following the same directions as with *Theming*, shadow this file: `settings/siteConfig.js`.

```javascript
import { siteConfig as baseSiteConfig } from "gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/src/settings/theme"

export const siteConfig = {
  ...baseSiteConfig,
  // Your overrides here
}

```

## Homepage and Pages
Use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to create pages, and edit this page from `src/static-pages`.
At the top of the page, setup the `path` in the `frontmatter` data:

```md
---
path: "/nueva-pagina"
title: "Nueva PÃ¡gina"
---
```

## Fragments
There's a few available reusable components we are calling "fragments" available: 

- Hero (the orange at the top ^)
- Paper (this one!)
- FeaturedProducts

(more to come!)

#### This is how the FeaturedProducts looks like:
