# con Gatsby ðŸš€

</Hero>

<Paper>

## Setup your Store

### Import data
Open `gatsby-config.js` and add your MercadoLibre info.

```javascript
options: {
  mercadoLibre: {
    siteID: "yoursiteid",
    user: "youruser",
  }
}
```
<a href="https://github.com/florantara/gatsby-source-mercadolibre/#readme" target="_blank">Read more ></a>

### Paths and Pagination
You can customize the slug for the products listing and the detail page paths.

The default pagination format is a "load more" button, but you can setup "paginated" pagination.

```javascript
options: {
  productDetail: {
    slug: "producto",
  },
  productsListing: {
    slug: "productos",
    enablePagination: true, // defaults to false
    productsListingPerPage: 3
  },
}
```

### Title and Logo
Use the `siteMetadata` for the `title`. We'll use this for SEO, and if there isn't a logo image.


```javascript
siteMetadata: {
  title: "Plants Store",
}
```

To import a logo, configure:

```javascript
options: {
  site: {
    logoURL:
      "https://placeholder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/placeholder.com-logo3.jpg",
    }
  }
}
```

## Shadow theme files
To override any file from the theme, create **in your site's `src/` folder**:

```
@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store
```
Then replicate the same folder/file structure from the theme that you want to shadow.

ðŸ”Œ Remember to restart the server for this to take effect.

## Theming

Most components come with a [Theme UI variant](https://theme-ui.com/guides/variants) setup you can use to style them, or you can style any component that the [Theme Spec](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec) provides.

[Variants reference >](https://github.com/florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/tree/master/theme/src/settings/variants)

#### Customize the theme

1. Install [lodash](https://lodash.com)
```bash
npm i --save lodash
```

2. Create a folder in your site to store the shadow files:
`yourProjectRoot/src/@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store`


3. Inside that folder create a `settings` folder, and then ` theme.js` file inside of it:

```javascript
// In settings/theme.js
import merge from "lodash/merge"
import { theme as base } from "@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/src/settings/theme"

export const theme = merge(base, {
  // Your overrides here
})

```
Follow the [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/theming) documentation to know what properties to use.

#### Typography

The theme uses [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the body and headings too.

You can configure any other typography you want in the `theme` settings - after importing it to your site with a plugin such as [gatsby-plugin-prefetch-google-fonts](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-prefetch-google-fonts/).

Use the [`fonts`](https://theme-ui.com/theming#typography) property of Theme UI.

```javascript
fonts: {
  heading: "Roboto, system-ui, sans-serif",
  body: "Roboto, system-ui, sans-serif",
}
```


## Site settings

We provide a set of settings for hiding/showing things, like the price on the products and the category, and also other site-wide configurations.


[Settings reference >](https://github.com/florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/blob/master/theme/src/settings/site.ts)


Following the same directions as with _Theming_, shadow this file: `settings/siteConfig.js`.

```javascript
// In settings/site.js
import merge from "lodash/merge"
import { siteConfig as base } from "@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/src/settings/site"

export const siteConfig = merge(base, {
  // Your overrides here
})

```

## Pages

### Homepage
This page is created automatically. From here, you can edit it from `src/static-pages/index.mdx`.

### Create and edit
Use markdown + jsx ([MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)) to create more pages. 

At the top of the page, setup the `path` and `title` like so:

You can also specify a css `class` that will be added to the page container if you need to add styles to your new page, using the `bodyClass` field.

For example: `src/static-pages/nueva-pagina.mdx`
```md
---
path: "/nueva-pagina"
title: "Nueva PÃ¡gina"
bodyClass: "pageHomepage"
---
```

## Fragments for Pages
There's a few available reusable components we are calling "fragments" available: 

- Hero (the orange at the top ^)
- Paper (this one!)
- FeaturedProducts
- Layout (width `compact` and `tiny` options) 
- Container (wraps everything with a maxWidth container)

(more to come!)

## Custom Fragments
You can create as many fragments as you want to use on the MDX pages. These can be buttons, banners, ads, etc.

1. In the shadow folder (read the "Override the settings" if you don't have one yet), create a `fragments` folder, and then an `index.js` file inside, with:

```javascript
// In fragments/index.js
import merge from "lodash/merge"
import { fragments as base } from "@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/src/fragments/index"

export const fragments = merge(base, {
  // Your new fragments here
})

```

Example:

```javascript
// In fragments/index.js
import merge from "lodash/merge"
import { fragments as base } from "@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/src/fragments/index"

import { MyCustomButton } from "../components/MyCustomButton";

// Custom fragments
export const fragments = merge(base, {
  MyCustomButton
})

```


#### This is how the FeaturedProducts looks like:
