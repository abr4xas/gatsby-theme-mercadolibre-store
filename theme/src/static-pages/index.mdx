## Setup your Store

### Import data
Open `gatsby-config.js` and add your MercadoLibre info.

```javascript
options: {
  mercadoLibre: {
    siteID: "yoursiteid",
    user: "youruser",
  }
}
```

### Paths and Pagination
You can customize the slug for the products listing and the detail page paths.

The default pagination format is a "load more" button, but you can setup "paginated" pagination.

```javascript
options: {
  productDetail: {
    slug: "producto",
  },
  productsListing: {
    slug: "productos",
    enablePagination: true, // defaults to false
    productsListingPerPage: 3
  },
}
```

### Title and Logo
Use the `siteMetadata` for the `title`. We'll use this for SEO, and if there isn't a logo image.


```javascript
siteMetadata: {
  title: "Plants Store",
}
```

To import a logo, configure:

```javascript
options: {
  site: {
    logoURL:
      "https://placeholder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/placeholder.com-logo3.jpg",
    }
  }
}
```

## Shadow theme files
To override any file from the theme, create **in your site's `src/` folder**:

```
src/@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/
```
Then replicate the same folder/file structure from the theme that you want to shadow.

Remember to restart the server for this to take effect.

## Theming

Most components come with a [Theme UI variant](https://theme-ui.com/guides/variants) setup you can use to style them, or you can style any component that the [Theme Spec](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec) provides.

[Variants reference >](https://github.com/florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/tree/master/theme/src/settings/variants)

#### Override the settings

Create the file `settings/theme.js` in the site's `src/@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/` folder and add the following:

```javascript
import { theme as baseTheme } from "@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/src/settings/theme";

export const theme = {
  ...baseTheme
  // Your overrides here
};
```
> Note: You'll need to spread every nested object you want to override. We recommend using [lodash's merge method](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.14#merge) to mitigate this.


#### Typography

The theme uses [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the body and headings too.

You can configure any other typography you want in the `theme` settings - after importing it to your site with a plugin such as [gatsby-plugin-prefetch-google-fonts](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-prefetch-google-fonts/).

Use the [`fonts`](https://theme-ui.com/theming#typography) property of Theme UI.

```javascript
fonts: {
  heading: "Roboto, system-ui, sans-serif",
  body: "Roboto, system-ui, sans-serif",
}
```

## Site settings

We provide a set of settings for hiding/showing things, like the price on the products and the category, and also other site-wide configurations.

Following the same directions as with _Theming_, shadow this file: `settings/siteConfig.js`.

```javascript
import { siteConfig as baseSiteConfig } from "@florantara/gatsby-theme-mercadolibre-store/src/settings/site";

export const siteConfig = {
  ...baseSiteConfig
  // Your overrides here
};
```
> Note: You'll need to spread every nested object you want to override. We recommend using [lodash's merge method](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.14#merge) to mitigate this.

## Homepage and Pages
Use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to create pages, and edit this page from `src/static-pages`.
At the top of the page, setup the `path` in the `frontmatter` data:

```md
---
path: "/nueva-pagina"
title: "Nueva PÃ¡gina"
---
```

## Fragments for MDX
There's a few available reusable components we are calling "fragments" available: 

- Hero (the orange at the top ^)
- Paper (this one!)
- FeaturedProducts
- Layout (width `compact` and `tiny` options) 

(more to come!)

#### This is how the FeaturedProducts looks like:
