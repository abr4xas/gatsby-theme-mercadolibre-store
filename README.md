## Motivation

A few months ago I started chatting with some friends from Argentina (where I'm from) about how they are handling their e-commerces. Being a web developer means you get to help your friends with their digital challenges, and I love that.

I realized how resourceful entrepreneurs are nowadays: they use social media a lot and publish the products they are selling wherever they can.

MercadoLibre is a large platform that is conquering the online sales of Latin America, where the average user still doesn't fully trust buying things online from sites they don't know. They provide a wide range of tools for them to sell their stuff, and they excell at that.

Going back to my friends, they all share one thing: they managed to create a website showcasing their products by using either TiendaNube (similar to Shopify), a WordPress site, or some other creative way, but we all know the pitfalls those have... starting with costs and performance, followed by: they have to do the process of managing stock twice.

So I wanted to create a Gatsby site for them ("them" are "several different entrepreneurs with their own stores") that can use the data they already uploaded into ML.

I started creating a Gatsby [source plugin](https://github.com/florantara/gatsby-source-mercadolibre).

When I finished it, I was about to start coding each website, but Gatsby Themes launched, YAY!!! So instead of creating multiple sites, I created a theme.

## Install and setup

Find the [documentation](./theme/README.md) in the theme's folder.
